            <h2>Here is how the story of my journey begins....</h2>

            <div>
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                    I am currently a junior student majoring in computer science at the University of Central Florida.
                    Before I discovered my passion for coding in general and for software development in particular, I was studying 
                    business administration at my college. I picked business administration in the favor of my mohter because I did not know
                    what I wanted to do at the time. Even though it is interesting to me, I did not feel fit in. I mean I am interested in business
                    and I want to do business. However, at that time there was always a desire inside me to find a team and develop something with my team.
                    so, after joining in a workshop about programming with my friends, I fall in love with programming. I like the process of working on a team and solving a problem. 
                    And, I believe that programming is about use technology and knowledge of programming to improve the performance of education, workplacce, and health of people.

                </p>
                
                <p style="font-size: large;">
                    "A quote say every beginning is difficult, but it get easiers from there on." Because most of students in CS are men, I have experienced peer pressure and gender discrimination. 
                    However, I choose not to give up. I will continue pursuing my dream and oneday I will shine through the dark time.
                    
                    So I hope I have the opportunity to work on a potential team and develop incredible things with my members.
